## About 

The common layout of a Renoir program starts with the creation of a `StreamContext`, then one or more `Source`s are initialised creating a `Stream`. The graph of operators is composed using the methods of the `Stream` object, which follow a similar approach to Rust's `Iterator` trait allowing ergonomically define a processing workflow through method chaining.
